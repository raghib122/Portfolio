        <div class="accordion-body">Remember John Steinbeck's famous story "The  Pearl"? A man found a beautiful pearl, but it had one tiny flaw. He thought if he could just remove that little imperfection, the pearl would be the biggest and the most priceless one in the world. So he peeled off the first layer, but the flaw was still there.

          Then he took off the next layer, thinking it would disappear,but the flaw remained.
          
          He continued to take off each layer, until finally he had no pearl. The flaw was gone now, but so was the beautiful prize.
          
          No idea is perfect! No idea is without its problems. God sets it up that way in order for us to be humble enough to seek His help all along the way. </div>

          You Are Brilliant!
        </button>
      </h2>
      <div id="flush-collapseTwo" class="accordion-collapse collapse" data-bs-parent="#accordionFlushExample">
        <div class="accordion-body">The head of a well-known company decided to test the creativity of average people, se to he selected ten men from one of his factories. They were noneducated people at the bottom of the corporate ladder.

          The president led them into the executive headquarters and told them to sit in the big leather chairs around the huge board table. After they all sat down, he stood before them and explained why they had been chosen. have observed you people for some time now, and it has come to my attention that you all have remarkable gifts of creativity. This is why I have called you together today. Our company is facing a problem, and I believe that you ten men can come up with a solution.”
          
          He explained all of the details and then left the room for few hours, a little cynical of the whole idea. When he returned. he discovered they had found a solution.
          
          It was in that meeting that a great breakthrough was made. They had found an answer to the problem that his top corporate research and development had overlooked!
          
          The average “bottom-of-the-ladder person’ is potentially as creatively brilliant as the top executive who is sitting in the big office. The only drawback is the person on the bottom doesn’t realize he’s brilliant and doesn’t believe in his own ideas.
          
          The executive appealed to the employees’ pride! He appealed to their self-worth! This is how he explains it: ‘Every person is creative! They only have to believe it. When I told the men they were smart, they believed it! They came up with a solution, because they were not informed enough to know that the suggestion they made couldn’t be done. So, they came up with an idea that the rest of us never seriously considered because in our minds it was technologically impossible. And when they came up with the idea, we established it as a goal and solved the problem!”
          
          Every human being has virtually equal creative possibilities. But why isn’t the average person more creative? One simple reason: They don’t think they are creative. Nobody’s ever told them they’re creative, so they have never tried to be. There are incredible ideas that come to their minds once in a while, but they don’t do anything about them. And then, years later, they read that somebody else did something with the idea. And they say to themselves, I thought about that: why didn’t I do something about it?’
          
          I don’t suppose there is one fact that I can try to communicate to you that is more important than this next sentence: ‘All of you are brilliant!’ That’s a fact. All of us have incredibly creative potential, because all creative ideas come from God..</div>

          Psychological Immune System!!

      </h2>
      <div id="flush-collapseSix" class="accordion-collapse collapse" data-bs-parent="#accordionFlushExample">
        <div class="accordion-body">The immune system protects our body from outside invaders. These include germs such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi, and toxins (chemicals made by microbes). The immune system is made up of different organs, cells, and proteins that work together.

          But the psychological Immune System is something that protect us from emotional diseases, like sudden demise of someone closed ones or any emotionally triggered diseases….
          
          WHEN OUR SELF-CONTROL EFFORTS fail, we have a hidden ally that in time helps us feel better, or at least not too awful, no matter how badly we mess up or how harshly life treats us. Evolution provides us with automatic protective mechanisms that come to the rescue when life deals us terrible blows we simply cannot control, and when our strengths are insufficient, our cool system too tired, and our own fallible behaviors and fragile feelings get us in trouble.
          
          These mechanisms used to be called ego defenses, but early in this century Daniel Gilbert at Harvard, working with Timo thy Wilson from the University of Virginia and others, has broadened, revised, and more aptly renamed them the “psycho logical immune system.” This system creates a safety net to pro tect us from the effects of chronic stress, and it fortifies us so that we can cope with terrible news – like a routine checkup that turns into a cancer diagnosis, a plunge in retirement funds, a P45 announcing that it is time to clear out the office, or the sudden death of a person we love. While the biological immune system keeps us alive by protecting us against illness, the psycho logical immune system reduces perceived stress and helps us avoid depression. The stress-reducing and antidepressive effects of the psychological immune system bolster the biological immune system, and the two continuously interact to try to keep us smiling and healthy even when life is especially harsh… <strong>–Marshmallow Test by WALTER MISCHEL</strong></div>

          The Influence of Insignificant

      </h2>
      <div id="flush-collapseSeven" class="accordion-collapse collapse" data-bs-parent="#accordionFlushExample">
        <div class="accordion-body">Once there was a dear lady named Hazel who loved to sing simple, common songs. She decided to try out for the church choir. She told the choir director that she couldn’t read music, so he said, “We’ll let you sing, but just stay on tune.’ But she couldn’t stay on tune, so she had to drop out of the choir. Nothing really seemed to have any meaning in Hazel’s life. Her mother had recently died. When Hazel was young, she had spent most of her time caring for her mother, instead of dating and enjoying her adolescence. Consequently, she had never married.

          At the age of sixty, she felt as though she had failed in her attempt to find happiness in life. Alone, with no spouse or children, she couldn’t even fulfill her life goal of singing. Distressed and worried, as you can well imagine, she lived in a tiny one-bedroom apartment three or four flights above the street level in a big city. With her mother gone, she lived alone in an old, run-down, apartment building where only old people usually live.
          
          One day, as Hazel was on her way out, she saw a young hippie-looking guy moving into one of the small tenements He had a full beard and long hair. When she returned, all of her friends were talking about the new tenant. We’re in real trouble now,” said one lady. Once these tough-looking characters move in, they always take over!
          
          And all the old folks living in the apartment building started taking extra precautions, just in case the stranger was thief. Many even put extra locks on their windows and doors Nobody trusted him.
          
          This went on for several weeks. Then one night Hard came in later than usual. She entered the lobby very quietly, so she wouldn’t disturb any of the other tenants. After climbing two flights of stairs, she saw a suspicious-looking man in the hallway. Instead of screaming or running back down the stain, she began to sing! In her own off-key way she sang the first words that came to her. “When you walk through a storm hold your head up high and don’t be afraid of the dark. That’s the only song she could remember and she wasn’t even sure if the words were right. She sang on: …. Hold your head and you’ll never walk alone. Walk on, walk on, with hope in up high your heart and you’ll never walk alone. By this time she had reached her apartment. So she quickly opened the door and locked it securely, listening at the door for some kind of sound. She heard nothing, so she went to bed, grateful that she had made it safely to her place.
          
          The next morning she saw a torn, crumpled piece of paper under her door. It was from the rough-looking young man that everyone feared. This is what it said: ‘I don’t know who you are, but thank you for singing to me last night. I was ready to cash into commit suicide – but then you started to sing: “When you walk through a storm hold your head up high and you’ll never walk alone.” I want you to know that you saved my life. I’m going to another city where I know I can find the job I need. Thank you. Good-bye.”
          
          The power of a smile or the words of encouragement! Only God can say how valuable it is! Any impossibility thinker can count the seeds in an apple. Only God can count the apples in a seed! Only God knows how powerful your gift is..</div>
